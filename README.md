APP.JS

Apnekart is a responsive full eccomerce website
This code is a React application that uses the React Router library to handle client-side routing. It defines several routes for different pages of the application, such as the home page, about page, shop page, contact page, login page, signup page, forgot password page, cart page, checkout page, blog page, and product details page.

The Layout component is a common component that is rendered around each page of the application. It contains the common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation menu.

The ScrollToTop component is a custom component that is used to scroll to the top of the page when the user navigates to a new page.

The 
ShopContext component is a custom context that is used to share data between different components in the application.

Overall, this code sets up a basic React application with client-side routing and a common layout component.
